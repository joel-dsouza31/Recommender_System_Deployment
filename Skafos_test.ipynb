    "    <li> <b>Data issues:</b> The model with hybrid approach is more accurate with fewer data points and tend to perform badly when the data to be processed increases. This issue can be easily handled in production by keeping a threshold of k data points per user and pulling only the latest k interactions of the user with the system while retraining the model. This will not only solve the data issue but will also keep the model trained on the latest trends and behaviours of the user </li>\n",
    "    <li> <b>Trust:</b> Although some user behaviour can be modeled, there are many users whose actual behaviour and preferances are very different from the recommendations provided because of sparse data points and limited interaction with the system creating bias. The recommendations can also be manipulated by creating false reviews of certain products resulting in that product being the top of all charts. </li>\n",
    "    <li> <b>Lack of Innovation:</b>When the model is not retrained with new data, it may create a bias which negatively impacts the performance. For example, the Disney movie Frozen when released, if the model was not updated, recommended frozen food to users because of a bias created and the inability of the model to distinguesh the movie from other frozen items. </li>\n",

    "<li><b>R Squared</b> indicates how well data fits a model. Ranges from 0 to 1. A value of 0 means that the data is random or otherwise can't be fit to the model. A value of 1 means that the model exactly matches the data. You want your R Squared score to be as close to 1 as possible. </li>\n",
